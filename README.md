Overview
SSTB is the first framework to predict liver Proton Density Fat Fraction (PDFF) directly from standard ultrasound (US) B-mode images using a self-supervised, T2-weighted MRI (T2WI) bridge.
This offers a practical, cost-effective alternative to MRI-based PDFF, enabling broad clinical screening for fatty liver diseases.

Key Features
Self-supervised learning using both labeled and large-scale unlabeled US data.

T2WI bridge: T2-weighted MRI is used only during training for cross-modal feature alignment.

Uncertainty-augmented adversarial loss for robust segmentation and PDFF prediction.

State-of-the-art results: Outperforms existing multi-task and synthesis methods, even with limited data.
